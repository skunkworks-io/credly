## Introduction

This repository is part of the SkunkworksZA organization and is dedicated to fetching and displaying IBM-specific badges from Credly. The badges are filtered based on IBM courses and are then used to generate HTML and Markdown files for easy viewing.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to automate the process of retrieving IBM-related badges from Credly, matching them with IBM courses, and generating web-friendly content that can be easily accessed and shared.

## Best Practices

- **Keep your code clean and readable:** Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python.
- **Document your code:** Use docstrings and comments where necessary to explain the functionality.
- **Handle exceptions:** Ensure your code handles exceptions gracefully and provides meaningful error messages.
- **Regular commits:** Make regular commits with meaningful messages to keep track of changes.
